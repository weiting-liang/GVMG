# Analysis of Global Vaginal Microbial Genomes(GVMG)
Here we established an extensive catalog of global vaginal microbial genomes (GVMG) by integrating 10,665 in-house Chinese metagenomes with 2,967 publicly available metagenomes and 1,433 bacterial isolates. This catalog comprised 65,338 genomes from 890 prokaryotes, 11 eukaryotes and 6,590 viral taxonomic units, with many prokaryotes and viruses being not listed in public reference databases.
