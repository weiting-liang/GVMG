# Analysis of Global Vaginal Microbial Genomes(GVMG)
Here we established an extensive catalog of global vaginal microbial genomes (GVMG) by integrating 10,665 in-house Chinese metagenomes with 2,967 publicly available metagenomes and 1,433 bacterial isolates. This catalog comprised 65,338 genomes from 890 prokaryotes, 11 eukaryotes and 6,590 viral taxonomic units, with many prokaryotes and viruses being not listed in public reference databases.

We would like to thank DCS Cloud (https://cloud.stomics.tech) for providing the computational resources and software support necessary for this study.

## Genome assembly and binning
Required
```
fastp v0.20.1
bowtie2 v2.4.2
metaSPAdes v3.14.0 (for paired-end reads)
MegaHIT v1.2.9 (for single-end reads)
SPAdes v3.15.2 (for isolate sequences)
MetaBAT2 v2.15
MaxBin2 v2.2.7
CONCOCT v1.1.0
dRep v3.4.9
GRCh38
CHM13v2.0
```
The detailed data quality control and assembly binning steps are listed in the article method. The specific operational steps are outlined below.   
Prepare a list of fastq files(.rmhost.1.fq.gz) that have been quality controlled and removed from the host sequence and store it in the samples_rmhost1.txt file.   
**Step1: Get batch-run assembly command scripts and run**
```
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_pe_metaspades.sh #output assembly_pe.sh
sh assembly_pe.sh
```
If it is a single-ended sample, store the list of .rmhost.fq.gz in samples_rmhost1.txt:
```
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_se_megahit.sh #output assembly_se.sh
sh assembly_se.sh
```

**Step2: Prepare the nearest 20 samples for multi-sample binning**
```
ls ./output/assembly/*.scaffolds.fa.gz > scaffolds.fa.gz.list
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_mash_distance_work.sh  #1000 samples took 20 minutes
Rscript ./Assembly_Binning/get_mash_colest20.R
```
If it is a single-ended sample:
```
ls ./output/assembly/*.contigs.fa.gz > contigs.fa.gz.list
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_mash_distance_work_se.sh
Rscript ./Assembly_Binning/get_mash_colest20.R
```

**Step3: Multiple sample binning**
```
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_mulbin_Metabat2_pe.sh #output bin_Metabat2_pe.sh
sh bin_Metabat2_pe.sh
If it is a single-ended sample:
sh ./Assembly_Binning/get_mulbin_Metabat2_se.sh #output bin_Metabat2_se.sh
sh bin_Metabat2_se.sh
```

**Step4: De-redundancy within the sample**
```
dRep dereplicate $sampleid_drep -p 8 -pa 0.9 -sa 0.99 -nc 0.3 --S_algorithm fastANI -comp 50 -con 5 -g $sampleid_binning/*.fa
```
